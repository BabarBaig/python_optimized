# python_optimized
Pythonic solutions for popular problems.<br>
Optimized for readability, code compactness, and time and space efficiency.<br>
Geared to outperform in edge cases such as large number of iterations, or large input strings/data structures.<br>
Generators are used for compactness and improved readability.  Goal is to avoid processing entire strings/data structures unless unavoidable.<br>
Robust error checking is used to bring it a little closer to production-grade code.
